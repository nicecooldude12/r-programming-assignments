assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)

myMean <- function(assignment2) {
  return(sum(assignment2) / length(assignment2))
}

myMean(assignment2)

#This works because â€˜assignment2â€™ is in its rightful place. The sum adds up all of the existing numbers in the list and divides it by the length that exists aswell. Answer is 19.25.
